                Asif does not believe in ghosts. He lives with his wife Rashmi and his late brother's son Shaan. They're invited to Rashmi's parents' Ratna and Sachin's house for their silver jubilee. Rashmi's father disapproves of the couple as Rashmi had eloped with Asif without her parents' permission, but her mother is kind to them. On arriving, Asif and his family face an accident, but no one is hurt. They meet Rashmi's brother Deepak and his wife, Ashwini. Asif and Shaan visit grounds that are believed to be haunted. While he is putting stumps into the ground, the stumps hit a buried body. Blood from the body gets on the stumps, and Asif washes them; the blood is thrown into a lemongrass plant.
                Ratna, Ashwini, and Deepak all have supernatural experiences. Ratna and Ashwini visit a priest; he tells them three ways to verify a ghost's presence. When all three steps he mentioned happen, it confirms that there is a spirit in the house. Asif makes a lemongrass tea with the same plant where the washed the blood. When he drinks it, the ghost possesses him, and he begins to act effeminate. The family confronts him, and it is revealed that three ghosts have kept him: a violent transgender woman, a man, and a mentally disabled boy. Asif's family hires an exorcist who drives the spirit out of his body; the woman's ghost, trapped, reveals her story.
                Laxman Sharma alias Laxmi is a transgender woman who her parents disowned. She is offered shelter by a man named Abdul Chacha, who has an intellectually disabled son. Regretting that she could not become a doctor, she adopts another transgender girl named Geeta and works hard to support her financially. When Geeta leaves to study medicine abroad, Laxmi buys a land plot to construct a low hospital. The crooked MLA Girja unlawfully takes her property. Laxmi angrily confronts Girja, who kills her, Abdul Chacha, and his son. Before she dies, she vows to kill Girja, his wife, and his henchmen. The bodies are buried in Laxmii's ground.
                After hearing her story, Asif is touched. Risking danger, Laxmi possesses Asif once more as Laxmi confronts Girja and gruesomely disposes of his henchmen. Girja seeks refuge in a Goddess Laxmi's temple, which Laxmii cannot enter. Asif forcibly makes Girja come out, and Laxmi kills him, getting her vengeance. A few months later, Asif has constructed the hospital for Geeta as per Laxmii's wishes. He also unites with Rashmi and her family. It is revealed that Laxmii exists symbiotically in Asif's body to help him out when the need arises.
